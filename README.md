# Todo App
# I Build this App Using Mern Stack

# React-Based Todo App 
Your project is a web application developed with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

# Task Management
The app allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. Each task includes a title, description, and a checkbox to mark it as completed.

# User Authentication
Your app includes user authentication. It checks whether a user is authenticated, ensuring that only authorized users can access and interact with their tasks.

# Server Integration
The app communicates with a backend server using HTTP requests to perform actions like creating new tasks, updating task status, and retrieving tasks associated with the authenticated user.

Styling: You've styled the app using SCSS, enhancing the user interface with a visually appealing design, including a responsive layout for a better user experience.
